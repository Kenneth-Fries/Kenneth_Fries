Here's the problem and an attached CSV. The revenue column refers to a subscription fee that is renewed every year.

1. Get the average monthly revenue for each customer.
2. Output this average revenue to a csv as a per month amount. For example if Susan was subscribed for 12 months she would have 12 rows with the average amount in each.
3. If a subscription is cancelled before the subscription period is up, all remaining revenues should be attributed to the last month (e.g. if revenue from Susanâ€™s subscription breaks down to $10/month and she cancels with three months remaining, each month should show $10 for revenue except the month of cancellation which should show $30).

*DO NOT USE PANDAS* Use Python standard libraries only.

I was given 70 minutes to complete this, for reference :slightly_smiling_face:
